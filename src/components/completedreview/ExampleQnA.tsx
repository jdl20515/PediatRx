When I read your extracurriculars, I see an interest in 5 separate topics: environmental issues, robotics, communications, biology, and law. For that reason, I am giving you a B+.

Your nonprofit specifically is very impressive, and I like how you have already made a tangible impact through it. Furthermore, your research done is impressive, although a high school student journal is not seen as incredibly impressive through the eyes of a college admissions officer. If you decide to do future research, try to strive to publish in a journal that is not student focused. Lastly, your internship at Pearson-Specter is very impressive, although it feels a little out of place. Your recent work has been very STEM-centric, and although the internship is definitely something to brag about in your college application, it may not end up playing a central role when building your spike. Overall, I rated your IC an A- due to several very strong out of school projects that show you are truly passionate about making change.",

If you can use the time you have remaining to effectively tie together your extracurriculars behind one topic, you would be in great shape and have an extremely high chance of making it into a top school. Additionally, your essays need to be well-made. I recommend that you start drafting early—around May—to ensure you have enough time to write quality work.

The robot should scan terrain to find an optimal spot where it can plant the seeds. Each seed could be enclosed in a pod that contains nutrients to give the seed the ability to grow. Once the robot finds a viable location, it should plant the seeds and remain there to water them with a built-in water tank. The impact of this robot could be worldwide, and could be used to automate much of the hard work that farmers do on a day to day basis.",
